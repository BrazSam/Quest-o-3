    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

    <p>Struggling doorknob salesman Steve breaks into a mine to fulfill a childhood dream, when he discovers the Orb of Dominance and the Earth Crystal. When combined, they create a portal that transports him to the Overworld, a world where the terrain is made of easily manipulated cubes. He builds his own paradise and later stumbles across a portal to a hellish world called the Nether. He is imprisoned by Malgosha, the gold-obsessed piglin ruler of the Nether who hates creativity. Because the Orb would allow her to control the Overworld, Steve has his dog Dennis hide it and the Crystal under his bed in the real world.</p>
    <input type="text" value="When Steve mentions that he has a large hoard of diamonds, Garrett becomes interested and demands access as an added condition of handing over the Orb. They find the hoard, but Henry is angered by the detour and worries about Natalie's safety. When the Great Hog arrives, they flee using minecarts and the Hog is blown up by creepers. Arriving at the mansion, Steve and Garrett attempt to distract the inhabitant pillagers while Henry acquires both the Earth Crystal and an Ender Pearl, which can facilitate one teleport. Malgosha returns and blows up the bridge to the mansion. Steve and Henry lose the Orb but escape as Garrett seemingly sacrifices himself in the blast. The two awaken with Dawn, Natalie, and Dennis in a mushroom house they built.">
